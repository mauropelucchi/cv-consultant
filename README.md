Generative AI can be used to significantly improve resumes by tailoring them to the specific demands of the current job market.
By analyzing online job postings, AI can identify the most in-demand skills, qualifications, and keywords for a given role. Using this information, generative AI tools can automatically update a resume, adding relevant skills and phrasing to better match job descriptions. The process helps job seekers understand which skills are most valued in their desired field, guiding them in upskilling efforts to align more closely with industry needs.
By learning from and incorporating job posting data, AI ensures resumes are always current, tailored, and impactful in the competitive job market.


## From the thesis of Jacopo Bellosi
This thesis proposes the development of an AI chat system designed for career enhancement, focusing initially on analyzing users' resumes to provide tailored feedback on elements such as job titles, design, and summary sections. Subsequently, users can engage in interactive dialogue, seeking advice on career paths, requesting revisions to their resume summaries, and obtaining salary expectations. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the system aims to streamline the career development process, offering personalized guidance and insights to empower users in their professional endeavors. The project will involve UX design, user research, and testing to ensure the effectiveness and usability of the chat application. Through this research, I aim to create a comprehensive tool that facilitates informed decision-making and fosters career growth for individuals.
